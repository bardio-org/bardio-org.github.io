# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 27th March 2025**

Thank you for choosing to use the Bardio app (the "App").
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use
the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of
information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is a free
educational tool.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

- **Local and Platform-Based Storage**  
  The App does **not** collect or store personal data on our servers.  
  All user data is saved locally on your device or optionally in iCloud
  (iOS) or other similar mobile cloud storage services if you choose to
  enable such features. Any information you generate (e.g., bookmarks, 
  settings) stays within the Appâ€™s local storage or within the
  chosen cloud storage platform.

- **No Personal Information**  
  We do not directly collect or request any personally identifiable
  information (such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers).

## 3. Security of Your Data

Since all data is stored on your device or within your chosen cloud
storage platform, we rely on the security measures provided by those
platforms (e.g., device encryption, iCloud security). We encourage you
to follow best practices to protect your device and your cloud accounts
(e.g., using strong passwords, keeping software up-to-date).

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
posted within the App or in the relevant app store listing. You are
advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. The
"Last updated" date at the top indicates when this Privacy Policy was
last revised.

practices, feel free to contact us at:
